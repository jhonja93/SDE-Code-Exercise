# SDE code exercise

This project was made with Node v18.1.0.

To run this project yo need to provide a addresses file and a drivers file like arguments at the moment to execute this Node program, look the following example:

```
node index.js address.txt drivers.txt
```
Inside the data folder there are two example files:
```
address.txt
drivers.txt
```
You are free to make any changes to these files.

Note: The number of drivers must be the same as the number of addresses.

The output is a JSON that relates an address with a driver and its respective score.
